The Strip is the answer if you don’t know where to go in Las Vegas, USA. This almost 3-kilometer long section runs through the middle of Sin City and is lined with luxury resorts, theme places, grand restaurants, and jubilant casinos. It is even better to visit the Strip at night as the whole city is then illuminated with yellow lights and neon signs, making it an enthralling experience. Frankly, all the best places to see in Las Vegas are either around or near the Strip.
