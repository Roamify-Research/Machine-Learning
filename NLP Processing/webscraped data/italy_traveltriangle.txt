History in Italy: The Best Places to Visit

The history of Italy, then
Rome, dated back to nearly 753 BCE, and it has witnessed prolific
growth in terms of art and culture. From the emergence of the Roman
Catholic Church to giving birth to the Renaissance to nurturing
humanism, the country’s influence on the world’s course of history is
unfathomable. No doubt Italians are so proud of their cultural
heritage. They have a natural inclination towards classic art, dynamic
music and good food. The country is home to some of the greatest icons
from the past, and it treasures almost 50% of the world’s most iconic
arts.

When to Visit Italy?

The spring (March-May)
and the autumn (September-November) is perhaps the best time to visit
Italy, especially if you want less crowd and more tranquility. At the
same time, the weather also remains comfortable during this time.
During the summer (July-August), the tourists’ group reaches its peak,
making it difficult to enjoy the sightseeing peacefully. Moreover, you
do not need to break the bank to have an Italy trip. Italy is less
expensive when compared to the other nations of the EU, like the UK.
However, the prices go higher than usual during the peak season of the
summer.

Italy is famous for its bright and colorful festivals. If you
are traveling to Italy during the festival season, you cannot afford
not to participate in them. Some of the very popular festivals are
Carnevale, Palio de Siena, Procession of Mysteries, Battle of Oranges,
Riggata, and Infiorata Festival.

In this article, We will tell you
about the best places to visit in Italy for the first time. Let’s find
out what are those best Italy tourist places:

1. Colosseum

Colosseum is a vast arena built by the Roman Empire, and it
is also their most enormous surviving edifice. It was made to fulfill
the demand for public entertainment through sports and spectacles. The
whole oval-shaped structure of the Colosseum was 186 meters long and
156 meters wide.

The Colosseum is one of the best places to visit in
Italy with family. You can see it on your own, but going for a guided
tour would be more convenient, keeping the tourist rush in mind. Also,
do not forget to visit the Hypogeum and the Upper Tiers and most of
the tourists tend to neglect them. Walking through the underground
tunnels and seeing the lion cages will give you goosebumps. Also, try
to cover the nearby attractions like the Arch of Constantine, Roman
Forum and Palatine Hill.

You can try Colosseo Metro Cafe situated
just opposite the Colosseum’s entrance if you want some snacks. Other
good options are Royal Art Cafe, Osteria Angelino (Roman cuisine), and
Via Capo d’Africa.

2. The Grand Canal, Venice

Who
has not dreamt of a gondola ride in Venice? No one, perhaps. Venice, a
city of islands, uses the waterways as their streets. The Grand Canal
is the largest among those numerous passageways. It has the most
beautiful of the palaces situated by its sides. These palaces belong
to some of the wealthiest families and date back from the 13th to the
18th century.

If you want to enjoy a gondola ride avoiding the crowd,
you should visit the Grand Canal before 9 in the morning. A typical 40
minutes of gondola right in the morning costs around 80 Euros. An
additional charge of 20 Euros will have to be paid for an extra 20
minutes. The prices are generally high in the evening.
