On the north side of the fort, a rampart of red-brown laterite forms a jetty between two small sandy coves, known as Sinquerim Beach. The fort houses the Central Jail and a 19th-century lighthouse. It was built by the Portuguese between 1609-1612. The fort is open from 9:00 AM to 6:30 PM every day, and there is no entry fee.\",\n",
